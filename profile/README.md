# Hi there 👋

Welcome to the **KnetMiner** GitHub organisation! 

We're a team passionate about developing gene discovery software to facilitate the analysis and visualisation of intricate biological networks. Our ambition is to help researchers decipher large datasets and reveal the hidden connections within.

## 💡 What is KnetMiner all about?

KnetMiner is a software companion in the world of scientific discovery, unravelling the intricate realm of genetics and making it accessible and usable for everyone, from seasoned researchers to industry innovators. We bridge the gap between the considerable amount of available information and the meaningful connections that lead to discovery.

KnetMiner is a window into an interconnected world of genetic, 'omics, and phenotypic information. With multispecies knowledge graphs, KnetMiner enables users to leverage insights from a broad array of species, expanding the horizons of gene discovery research.
